# pattern-recognition

The task is related to the pattern recognition. There are some example input datasets available for the project (i.e., "datasets" directory), however, you can use other datasets available in the Internet. 
The scheme of experiments (that are required for both passive and active mode) should be based on "example_experiments.py" file. In more detail, the following steps are required:
# 1. Selection of datasets and classifiers 
# 2. For each dataset and classifier:
## 2.1 preprocessing (including data normalization and cross-validation)
## 2.2 model adjustment / model preparation
## 2.3 prediction / classification
## 2.4 assesment of prediction quality
## 2.5 data presentation and statistical analysis

For the passive mode, we can use standars classifiers (i.e., given in the example project). For the active version you need to implement your own classifier similarly like in "method.py" file.
